# Da Synth Dude

**Da Synth Dude** has been built using the Web Audio API and is unique in as much as
it allows the user to record the music they are creating directly from the running
oscillators, rather than though a microphone.

The project is in its infancy, but we do have a machine that allows you to do the
following:

- Play musical notes from a range of twelve octaves:- 0 through 7 as on a full size
  keyboard
- Change the octave, wave and decay of the notes to create different voices
- Play a range of drums: Kick, Kettle, Snare, Hi-hat
- Play pre-recorded music to play along side with
- Record as you play including the ability to record on top of pre-reorcded music that
  that you are playing along to.
- Download the recording directly from the Audio Player for editing etc.

This could be the start of something great!

## The State of Play

At the moment, the user has no direct way to upload the musical composition that they
have created. However, the file can be saved as **music.wav** in the **audio folder.**
That file can then be played back via the **Pre-Recorded Music** function of the UI.

There's an awful lot more that we can do to build on this app, such as create more
voices / instruments and indeed; give the user the abiliity to use musical compositions
they have created directly from the GUI. How we do this has yet to be decided, perhaps
we could use local storage, instead of uploading to the server. If we give the ability
to upload to the server, then we must also provide a method of selecting the file to be
played via the GUI, At present, the app only looks for one file **music.wav** and it is
the only file that can be played, however, it can be overwritten as stated above.

## Collaborators

We'd love to have anyone interested in music contribute to this project. If you'd like
to get involved just DM me, fork the repo', do some cool stuff, do a pull request :Â¬)

## Open Source

That's the question, do we make this an open source project, or, do we license it
some other way? We are all ears on this topic!
