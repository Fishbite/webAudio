        <h3>Welcome to the Digital Audio Synth</h3>
        <p>
          An open source project free to sell, distribute, modify and build
          upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a desktop application which will not function without a
          physical keyboard. You could use a tablet device with a keyboard, but
          mobile phones are not suitable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have some fun, make some tunes for your games and let us hear your
          creations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b> If things get a little awry, amiss, as in the sound
          starts to distort and go <i>"snap" "crackle" & "pop"</i> just refresh
          the browser and everything will be back to normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><i>CAUTION!</b></i> The sounds are best heard through earphones /
          headphones but, <b>TURN THE VOLUME DOWN FIRST!!!</b> and ramp it up
          gradually or you will go deaf :-P

          <h4>DA SYNTH DUDE</h4>
          <p>What you can do with this app:</p>
          <h5>New In Release 3:</h5>
          <p>Select music a file from your hard drive!</p>
          <p>
            You can now select the music you have downloaded from the Media
            Recorder. Then play additional music / beats on top of that while
            recording at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, load any music track from your computer and record on
            top of it!
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>select an instrument from a dropdown list</li>
            <li>play some musical notes</li>
            <li>change the octave that the keyboard plays</li>
            <li>control the decay (the duration that each note plays)</li>
            <li>change the wave form from a smooth sine to harsh sawtooth</li>
            <li>play some drums; kick, kettles, snare and Hi Hat</li>
            <li>set the echo on the kettle drums for really funky sounds</li>
            <li>record the music as you play</li>
            <li>download the recording directly from the Media Recorder</li>
            <li>upload the edited file (I use Audacity) as music.wav</li>
            <li>play back the uploaded file and record on top of it</li>
            <li>have some fun creating tunes</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
