        <h3>Welcome to the Digital Audio Synth</h3>
        <p>
          An open source project that is free to distribute, modify and build
          upon.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a desktop application and will not function without a physical
          keyboard. You could use a tablet device with a keyboard, but mobile
          phones are not suitable and the interface will not scale down to
          mobile phone size screens. UPDATE OK! We decided that you should at
          least be able to view the site on mobile, so, we did that for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have some fun, make some tunes for your games and let us hear your
          creations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b> If things get a little awry, amiss, as in the sound
          starts to distort and go <i>"snap" "crackle" & "pop"</i> just refresh
          the browser and everything will be back to normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>CAUTION!</b> The sounds are best heard through earphones /
          headphones but, <b>TURN THE VOLUME DOWN FIRST!!!</b> and ramp it up
          gradually or you will go deaf :-P

          <h4>DA SYNTH DUDE</h4>
          <p>What you can do with this app:</p>
          <h5>New In Release 3:</h5>
          <p>Select music a file from your hard drive!</p>
          <p>
            You can now select the music you have downloaded from the Media
            Recorder. Then play additional music / beats on top of that while
            recording at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, load any music track from your computer and record on
            top of it!
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>play some musical notes</li>
            <li>change the octave that the keyboard plays</li>
            <li>control the decay (the duration that each note plays)</li>
            <li>change the wave form</li>
            <li>play some drums; kick, kettles, snare and Hi Hat</li>
            <li>set the echo on the kettle drums for really funky sounds</li>
            <li>record the music as you play</li>
            <li>download the recording directly from the Media Recorder</li>
            <li>upload the edited file (I use Audacity) as music.wav</li>
            <li>play back the uploaded file and record on top of it</li>
            <li>have some fun creating tunes</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
